1. Can choose when to consume a building program
1. You can build cities on edges of the map (not next to unexplored map tiles)
1. Should we play with all hut/village tiles:

| Tile | Cody's thoughts |

| Coin | Maybe instead of it being a coin token, it just be a coin on the map so people can contest it |
| Military unit | OP |
| +4 production | OP |
| +3-6 extra culture | OP |
| Learn tech 1 for free | OP |

## Start of Turn Phase
Advance first player token (skip this the first turn of the game). This phase is done in turns. The first player fully completes this phase before it passes to the next person. You may any of the following actions as many times as you want.

### Build a city
Requirements:
1. Starting city limit is 2
1. Cannot be built on water
1. Requires eight adjacent revealed squares
1. Cannot be adjacent to a hut or village token (it's valid once you remove this token from the map)
1. Cannot be adjacent to an enemy figure
1. Its outskirts must not overlap with any other city’s outskirts

To build a city, sacrifice your scout. Move any other friendly figures in this square to a legal adjacent square. Add a city token to the map where your scout was. Adopt a new social policy. Each “Start of Turn” ability on a social policy card can only be used once per turn. If a card has two abilities, both can be used once. When you lose a city, then you lose a social policy card (but can later re-learn that same one if you want)

### Play a reserved great person tile
Play a reserved great person tile on your civilization sheet into one of your city's outskirts

### Change government
Change your government in one of the following ways:
1. Change to a government you unlocked last turn
1. Change to anarchy for a turn (on your next turn you can change to any government)
1. Change to any government you have unlocked (requires you to have been in anarchy for a turn)

### Invest a coin (if playing with this optional rule)
Requirements:
1. Can only invest coin tokens
1. Can not invest coins printed on the map, printed on tech cards, or printed on buildings

To invest a coin, lower your economy coin dial by 1. This coin no longer counts towards your 15 coin victory condition 1. Place an investment marker on an investment card. Investments cannot be removed by other players

## Trade Phase
Everyone does the following actions at the same time in any order

### Gather Trade
Add together the number of trade icons in all of your cities' outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though). Increment your trade dial equal to the total number of trade icons
   
### Trade with other players
You can trade any of the following:
1. Points of trade
1. Culture tokens
1. Resource tokens
1. Culture event cards

## City Management Phase
This phase is done in turns. The first player fully completes this phase before it passes to the next person

### Culture Track
At any time during this phase, you may pay to advance on the culture track as many times as you want

#### Culture Track Advancement Cost

| Tier | Culture Cost | Trade Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | 3 Culture | 0 Trade |
| Tier 2 | 5 Culture | 3 Trade |
| Tier 3 | 7 Culture | 6 Trade |

#### Culture Track Advancement Benefits

| Square you advance to | Benefit |
| --- | ---  |
| Column Icon | Draw a culture event card |
| Star Icon | Gain a great person |

One at a time, for each of your cities do the following: 

### Count Production
Add together the number of production icons in your city's outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though).

#### Rush Production
If you want to perform a city action but you don't have enough production from this city then you can rush production. You can convert 3 trade points to a single point of production. You can do this as many times as you want.

### Perform only one of the following actions:
#### Deploy an army figure
Costs 4 production. Limited to 6 army figures. Place an army figure in a legal square in your city's outskirts where you built this unit. If this square contains an enemy unit, a battle immediately takes place
    
#### Deploy a scout figure
Costs 6 production. Limited to 2 scout figures. Place a scout figure in a legal square in your city's outskirts where you built this unit

#### Recruit an artillery, infantry, or mounted military unit card
Determine which type of military unit card you want to recruit. Pay the cost corresponding to what rank you are for that unit. Then add that military unit card to your military unit hand.

| Rank | Production Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Rank 1 | 5 production |
| Rank 2 | 7 production |
| Rank 3 | 9 production |
| Rank | 11 production |

#### Recruit an aircraft military unit card
This requires you to have the tech card flight unlocked. An aircraft unit costs 12 production. Add an aircraft military unit card to your military unit hand.

#### Build a building
Requirements:
1. The technology to be unlocked corresponding to this building
1. Cannot be built on top of an enemy figure 
1. Each city can only have a single building with a star in its outskirts
1. Building tiles are limited

Place this building in your city's outskirts. You may replace an existing building, wonder, or great person tile. If it's a wonder, you lose the wonder card. If it's a great person tile, you will lose the great person card.
    
#### Build a wonder
Requirements:
1. Cannot be built on top of an enemy figure
1. Each city can only have 1 wonder 
1. A blockaded wonder tile prevents use of the corresponding wonder card
1. An obsoleted wonder removes the corresponding wonder card but leaves the wonder tile
1. When a wonder tile is destroyed, remove the corresponding wonder card

Place this wonder in your city's outskirts. You may replace an existing building, wonder, or great person tile. If it's a wonder, you lose the wonder card. If it's a great person tile, you will lose the great person card. Replace the wonder from the market.

#### Art Devotion
When you devote a city ot the arts, gain culture as follows. Gain 1 culture (2 if the city is a metropolis). Gain 1 additional culture for each culture token in your outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though)

#### Resource Harvest
Harvest a single resource in your city’s outskirts (if the market has a corresponding token available)
    
####  Building Program
Place a building program marker on the city (max 1 building program marker per city). The next time this city spends production, double the production generated and remove the token

## Movement Phase
This phase is done in turns. The first player fully completes this phase before it passes to the next person. One at a time, for each of your figures you can perform a move action. If multiple figures start the movement phase in the same square, then they can choose to perform their move action together if the player wants (they don't have to move together). This can be beneficial to increase your combat hand size. Move up to your figure travel speed. You must fully finish this move action before beginning a move action with any other figure.

Requirements:
1. Starting figure travel speed is 2
1. Starting figure stacking limit is 2
1. Figures cannot move diagonally
1. Figures can move through friendly city centers, but they can only end their movement on it if they wish to sacrifice that figure
1. Figures can end their movement on friendly buildings, wonders, and great person tiles

### Blockade
Any figure can blockade an enemy square by moving onto it and occupying it. A blockaded square cannot be used by its owner in any capacity.

### Exploration
Any figure can explore a facedown map tile. Exploring a map tile requires the figure to have a point of movement speed available and it consumes that point of movement speed. When the map tile is flipped faceup, orient it so the triangle is on the same side as the figure that explored it.

### Army Figure
This figure represents your military power and presence. This is the only figure that can enter squares containing huts, villages, enemy figures, and enemy units. Doing any of these causes your army figure to end your movement. 

#### Explore Hut
If an army figure enters a square containing a hut, it ends its movement. Then remove and add the hut resource token from the map to your civilization sheet. Keep this hidden from others until you use it. 

#### Pillage Village
If an army figure enters a square containing a village, it ends its movement and then that player will fight the barbarians. The next player will represent the barbarians in battle. The barbarians (being played by the next player) receive a rank 1 archer unit card, a rank 1 spearman unit card, and a rank 1 horseman unit card. Then they engage in battle until it is finished. If the main player wins, they remove the village token from the map and add it to their civilization sheet. Keep this hidden from other players until you use it. After the battle, ignore loot effects.

#### Commence Combat
If an army figure enters a square containing an enemy figure or enemy cit, it ends its movement and engages in a battle with that player.

#### City Fortification
Have an army figure end its movement in a city center and then remove it from the board. Add a fortification marker on that city center (may of 1 per city). The next time it is attacked, it gains a +2 combat bonus and is then discarded.

### Scout Figure
This figure exists to further your economy. It cannot enter squares containing huts, villages, or enemy figures. Scouts are killed immediately any time they are attacked by an army, unless they have a friendly army escorting them (this triggers end of battle effects such as loot).

#### City Caravan
Have a scout figure end its movement in a city center and then remove it from the board. Add a caravan marker on that city center (max of 1 per city). When this city performs a city action that requires production, you may consume this caravan marker to gain an additional 2 production.

## Technology Research Phase
The Tech Pyramid

Explain how much a technology csots

* parallel
Each player may learn one new tech by spending trade They then add their newly learned tech to their tech pyramid When a player learns a tech unlocking an upgraded building, they immediately flip over any of the corresponding basic buildings that they’ve already produced in their cities. Researching a tech spends all of the player’s remaining trade, no matter how much trade they had before researching. The only exception to this rule is for players who possess coins. Coins allow a player to retain 1 trade after researching for each coin the player possesses. Having coins never increases a player’s current trade; it only allows a player to retain trade they already have. A player does not need to know the tech that unlocks the basic form of a building in order to learn the tech that unlocks the upgraded form of that building.
  
The Railroad technology card should have a coin icon.

The Metal Casting technology card should not have a coin icon.

When you research a technology that grants you a coin, this coin will count for the purpose of the trade you keep after researching that technology. 

City Walls are an excellent defensive measure for a player to
build when it appears that one of their cities is in danger of being
attacked. A wall provides +4 to a player’s strength total when
defending that city and forces the attacker to play a unit first in
the battle (see pages 23–24)

* Technology card resource abilities
  * Limited to once per turn
  
### Metropolis
You capital can be upgraded to a larger metropolis by researching the agriculture tech. To upgrade your capital the following conditions must be met:

* When devoted to the arts, a metropolis produces a base of 2 culture instead of 1
* A metropolis receives an extra +2 combat bonus when a player is defending it
* A metropolis may extend partially into water and doesn’t count as water for movement, so its owner can use it as a makeshift bridge.
* The metropolis marker must occupy the square that the capital marker occupied plus one of its four nondiagonally adjacent squares (this square is called its expansion square).
* The expansion square must not contain any enemy figures.
* If the expansion square contains any friendly figures, the player immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can legally end their movement in.
* If the expansion square contains a wonder, great person, or building, then the square’s previous contents are overbuilt, as described in the core rulebook.
* An expansion square may be a water square. If so, the square is no longer considered to be water for purposes of movement.
* The metropolis’s new outskirts cannot overlap another city’s outskirts, nor can the outskirts extend off the map or into unexplored territory
* If the expansion square contains any friendly figures, the player immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can legally end their movement in.

## Culture
### Culture Event Card
* Starting hand size is 2
* If you ever exceed your hand size, you must immediately discard down to it before you can play any culture event cards
* Culture event cards are kept secret from other players until you play them
* Culture event cards say at the top of the card which phase you can play these cards in
  
### Great Person
If you are playing with the optional great person deck, then draw a great person card and then a matching great person tile. Otherwise, just draw a random great person tile

#### Great Person Card
* Great person cards are kept secret from other players until you play them
* Great person cards say in what phase you can play them
* A player cannot use a great person’s ability unless they have at least one great person marker of that great person’s type on the map and not blockaded by an enemy unit

#### Great Person Tile
When you gain a great person tile, either immediately add this to the outskirts of one of your cities that is not occupied by an enemy figure or reserve this tile on your civilization sheet to play later.

When a great person tile is killed, the player must check to see whether they now have too many great person cards of that type. A player may only have one great person card for each great person tile of that type they possess (including markers on the map and those held in reserve), regardless of whether the cards are faceup or facedown. If a player has too many of the same type of great person card, they must randomly discard cards of that type (one at a time) until they no longer have too many.

## Combat
Default combat unit hand size is 3
* +2 for each friendly army figure in the square beyond the first
* +3 if defending a city or capital
* +1 if governed by Fundamentalism

The defender plays first, except if defending a city with wall.
Your turn in a battle is Ability > Card > Ability.
The battle ends after 2 subsequent turns where no player play neither a card neither an ability
Battle Turns
During the “Engaging in Battle” step of combat, players alternate taking battle turns, starting with the defender. Only the player currently taking his battle turn can use abilities (such as those found on tech cards or culture event cards) or play units. A player’s battle turn consists of:
1. Opportunity to use an ability
2. Play a unit
3. Opportunity to use an ability
4. Battle turn ends After a player plays his last unit, he does not take any more battle turns. Can a player win a battle if he has no units in the battle, but he has a high enough military bonus to win? A: Yes Can a player use resource abilities from tech cards during his “turn” in combat if he has no units left in his hand? A: Yes

When an army figure moves into a square containing a village marker, an enemy army figure, or an enemy city, a battle takes place.

* Finite resource
  This relationship is shown on the unit cards by their trump symbols. For example, infantry units are particularly effective against mounted units (e.g., pikemen versus knights), so infantry units have the mounted unit symbol as their trump symbol. When a unit attacks or is attacked by a unit that it has pictured on its card as a trump symbol, it trumps that unit, dealing its damage before the other unit can do so. If this damage kills the trumped unit, the trumped unit deals no damage back to the unit trumping it, since it is already dead before it can deal its damage.
  
Combat Bonuses
* Except cities, Do not include squares blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure
* +2 for every Barracks the player has built
* +4 for every Academy the player has built
* +4 for every Great General the player has on the map
* +6 if defending a non-capital city
* +12 if defending a capital city
* +4 if defending a walled capital or non-capital city (stacks with either of the two other city bonuses).

## Post-combat

All wounds go away at the end of the battle.

 Then, each player tallies up the strength of all of their surviving units, adding in the value of the combat bonus card (if they have it). The player with the highest total wins the battle, with ties going to the defender. Winner’s Figure Losses The winner then loses one army figure in the square for every two units of theirs that were killed in the battle. A player’s last army figure in the square can never be lost this way

If the loser had one or more figures in the square: The winner gains 1 loot. If the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities: The winner gains 2 loot. If the loser was defending their capital city: The winner immediately wins the game with a military victory.

### Single-Loot Effects
Choose one of the following:
1. Steal up to three points of trade from the loser’s trade dial
1. Steal up to three culture tokens from the loser
1. Steal any one resource token from the loser (facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they are before choosing)
1. Force the loser to discard a coin token of the winner’s choice. This cannot affect investments.

### Double-Loot Effects
Choose one of the following:
1. 2 single-loot effects (the same or different)
1. Learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner does not know, without having to pay the trade cost. The winner must have a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so.
1. Steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. The winner only gets to look at the card backs when choosing.
1. Steal one of the loser’s coin tokens and place it on the winner’s civilization sheet. This cannot affect investments.
