## Game Overview
Civilization is a turn-based strategy game where you play a civilization and balance your economic and military power. There is a map and you will need to expand your geographic domain strategically to emerge victorious.

1. Can choose when to consume a building program
1. Should we play with all hut/village tiles:

    | Tile | Cody's thoughts |

    | City-states | seems strong but not OP |
    | Coin | Maybe the coin stays on the map and isn't a coin token so people can contest it |
    | Military unit | OP |
    | +4 production | OP |
    | +3-6 extra culture | OP |
    | Learn tech 1 for free | OP |

## Start of Turn Phase
Advance first player token (skip this the first turn of the game)

One at a time, each player can do as many of these actions as they want in any order

1. Convert a scout to a new city
    * Starting city limit is 2
    * Cannot build a city on water
    * There must be eight revealed squares around it
    * Cannot be adjacent to a hut or village token (it's valid once you remove this token from the map)
    * Cannot be adjacent to an enemy figure
    * Its outskirts must not overlap with any other city’s outskirts
    * Sacrifice your scout
    * Move any other friendly figures in this square to a legal adjacent square
    * Adopt a new social policy

2. Play a great person tile from your reserve
   
3. Change government
    * Change to a government you unlocked last turn
    * Change to anarchy for a turn (on your next turn you can change to any government)
    * Change to any government you have unlocked (requires you to have been in anarchy for a turn)

4. Invest a coin (if playing with this optional rule)
    * Can only invest coin tokens
    * Can not invest coins printed on the map, printed on tech cards, or printed on buildings
    * Lower your economy coin dial by 1
    * This coin no longer counts towards your 15 coin victory condition
    * Gain an investment marker
    * Investments cannot be discarded from play by other players

## Trade Phase
Everyone should do this phase at the same time

1. Gather Trade: Add together the number of trade icons in all of your cities' outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though). Increment your trade dial equal to the total number of trade icons
   
1. Trade with other players
    * Points of trade
    * Culture tokens
    * Resource tokens
    * Culture event cards

## City Management Phase
Players take turns doing this phase

At any time during this phase, you may pay to advance on the culture track as many times as you want (See the [Culture](#culture) section)

One at a time, for each of your cities do the following: 

Gather Production:
Add together the number of production icons in your city's outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though)

Perform one of the following city actions:
1. Build an army figure 
    * Costs 4 production 
    * Place this unit in a legal square in your city's outskirts where you built this unit. If this square contains an enemy unit, a battle immediately takes place
    
1. Build a scout figure
    * Costs 6 production
    * Place this unit in a legal square in your city's outskirts where you built this unit. If this square contains an enemy unit, a battle immediately takes place

1. Build a military unit card
   
    | Tier | Production Cost |
    | --- | --- |
    | Tier 1 | 5 production |
    | Tier 2 | 7 production |
    | Tier 3 | 9 production |
    | Tier 4 | 11 production |

1. Build a building (requires a tech to unlock it)
    * Cannot be built on top of an enemy figure   
    * Each city can only have a single building with a star in its outskirts
    * Building tiles are limited
    
1. Build a wonder
    * Cannot be built on top of an enemy figure
    * Each city can only have 1 wonder 
    * Immediately replace the wonder from the market

1. Devote to the Arts
    * Gain 1 culture
    * Gain 1 additional culture if your city is a metropolis
    * Gain 1 additional culture for each culture token in your outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure
        * All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though)

1. Harvest a single resource in your city’s outskirts (if the market has a corresponding token available)
    
1. Start a building program
    * Place a building program marker on the city
    * Max 1 building program marker on a city
    * The next time this city spends production, double the production generated and remove the token


## Movement Phase
* Friendly figures may pass through, but they cannot end their movement in a city center
* Starting travel speed for army and scout figures is 2
* Starting stacking limit for army and scout figures is 2
* Turn phase 4
* One at a time
Move each of their figures (armies and scouts) up to a number of squares equal to the player’s travel speed.
Movement may cause battles to occur and facedown map tiles to be revealed
Move all of your figures before it passes to the next player
Figures cannot move diagonally
When discovering, flat part of triangle touches the figure that exposed it An army figure that enters a square containing a hut or village marker must immediately end its movement and is considered to be exploring the hut or village.
Scouts cannot enter a square containing enemy figures. If an army enters a square containing any enemy figures, its movement immediately ends. If the square contains only enemy scouts, the scouts are immediately killed and the attacking player collects loot as though they had won a battle (see page 25). If the square contains at least one enemy army, a battle occurs (see page 23). If the square contains a mix of both enemy armies and scouts, a battle occurs, but if the losing side in the battle has any scouts in the square, they are killed along with the armies; loot is then collected as normal.
Instead of the figure moving for that square of movement, the map tile is turned faceup.
Once a figure has begun its move, it must complete its move before any other figure may move.
A player may move several of their figures as a group if they all begin the Movement Phase in the same square. Doing so can offer extra strength in battle (see page 23) or allow armies to protect scouts (see page 20). Figures that begin in the same square are not required to move together.
A player may move their figures through their own city centers, but they may not end any figure’s movement in their city center. Scouts may enter enemy city outskirts, but they cannot enter enemy city centers. Armies may enter enemy city outskirts. They may also enter an enemy city center, but doing so immediately results in an attack on the city (see page 23).
Military bonuses and wonders abilities can be blockaded, even by a scout only, but it doesn’t send such abilities or bonus to the scouts’ owner. It does send the culture icons on the wonders.
In order to engage to a battle with a stack of 2 or more armies, they must be already in the same square at the beginning of your turn. This means that you have to group them in this turn if you want to attack with them all in the next turn.
Figures can move on friendly squares containing friendly buildings, wonders, great people, etc  but cannot end their movement on city centers.Blockade: When a square in a city’s outskirts contains an enemy figure. The presence of the enemy figure prevents the use of that square by the city it is part of the outskirts of.

An army figure that enters a square containing a hut
or village marker must immediately end its movement and is
considered to be exploring the hut or village.

Killing a lone enemy scout definitely gives you loot. I think it also counts as a battle. If
an army enters a square containing any enemy figures, its
movement immediately ends. If the square contains only enemy
scouts, the scouts are immediately killed and the attacking player
collects loot as though they had won a battle (see page 25).


1. Disband an army

1. Disband a scout

Scouts cannot enter a square containing enemy figures.

## Technology Research Phase

The Tech Pyramid

Explain how much a technology csots

* Certain techs (Monarchy and Gunpowder) allow a player to obsolete a wonder. When a wonder is obsoleted, turn its wonder card facedown, but leave its wonder marker on the map. The wonder’s special ability is negated and cannot be used for the rest of the game. However, the wonder marker still produces culture when the city it is in is devoted to the arts.
* Turn phase 5
* parallel
Each player may learn one new tech by spending trade They then add their newly learned tech to their tech pyramid When a player learns a tech unlocking an upgraded building, they immediately flip over any of the corresponding basic buildings that they’ve already produced in their cities. Researching a tech spends all of the player’s remaining trade, no matter how much trade they had before researching. The only exception to this rule is for players who possess coins. Coins allow a player to retain 1 trade after researching for each coin the player possesses. Having coins never increases a player’s current trade; it only allows a player to retain trade they already have. A player does not need to know the tech that unlocks the basic form of a building in order to learn the tech that unlocks the upgraded form of that building.
The Railroad technology card should have a coin icon.
The Metal Casting technology card should not have a coin icon.
When you research a tech that grants you a coin, you gain it immediately for the sake of paying trades for that research.
When you invest a coin that was over a tech, you can freely refill the tech

When you research a technology that grants you a coin, this coin will count for the purpose of the trade you keep after researching that technology. For example, a player with 1 coin on his economic dial that researches Bureaucracy, will immediately increase his economic dial by 1, and so will retain 2 trades.
City Walls are an excellent defensive measure for a player to
build when it appears that one of their cities is in danger of being
attacked. A wall provides +4 to a player’s strength total when
defending that city and forces the attacker to play a unit first in
the battle (see pages 23–24)

Upgrading a city into a metropolis:
* A metropolis has two extra squares in its city outskirts.
* When devoted to the arts, a metropolis produces a base of 2 culture instead of 1.
* A metropolis receives an extra +2 combat bonus when a player is defending it.
* A metropolis may extend partially into water and doesn’t count as water for movement, so its owner can use it as a makeshift bridge.
* The metropolis marker must occupy the square that the capital marker occupied plus one of its four nondiagonally adjacent squares (this square is called its expansion square).
* The expansion square must not contain any enemy figures.
* If the expansion square contains any friendly figures, the player immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can legally end their movement in.
* If the expansion square contains a wonder, great person, or building, then the square’s previous contents are overbuilt, as described in the core rulebook.
* An expansion square may be a water square. If so, the square is no longer considered to be water for purposes of movement.
* The metropolis’s new outskirts cannot overlap another city’s outskirts, nor can the outskirts extend off the map or into unexplored territory
* If the expansion square contains any friendly figures, the player immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can legally end their movement in.

## Culture
* Pay culture tokens and trade to advance on the culture track

    | Tier | Culture Cost | Trade Cost |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Tier 1 | 3 Culture | 0 Trade |
    | Tier 2 | 5 Culture | 3 Trade |
    | Tier 3 | 7 Culture | 6 Trade |

* If the square you advanced to is a normal culture track square and has columns on it
    * Draw a culture event card
    * Starting culture event hand size is 2
    * If you ever exceed your hand size, you must immediately discard down to it before you can play any culture event cards
    * Culture event cards are kept secret from other players until you play them
    * Culture event cards say at the top of the card which phase you can play these cards in
* If the square you advanced to has a star on it, then it is a great person square
    * If you are playing with the optional great person deck
        * Draw a random great person card
            * Great person cards are kept secret from other players until you play them
            * Great person cards say in what phase you can play them
            * A player cannot use a great person’s ability unless they have at least one great person marker of that great person’s type on the map and not blockaded by an enemy unit
        * Draw a great person tile that matches the great person card you drew
            * Either add this great person tile to the outskirts of one of your cities
            * Or hold this tile in reserve by placing it on your civilization sheets
                * You can put this into play during the start of turn
    * If you are not playing with the optional great person deck
        * Draw a random great person tile
            * Either add this great person tile to the outskirts of one of your cities
            * Or hold this tile in reserve by placing it on your civilization sheets
                * You can put this into play during the start of turn

## Combat
* Default combat unit hand size is 3
* +2 for each friendly army figure in the square beyond the first
* +1 if governed by Fundamentalism
* +3 if defending a city or capital

slaughtering scouts generates loot and I think counts as a battle
All wounds go away at the end of the battle.
The defender plays first, except if defending a city with wall.
Your turn in a battle is Ability > Card > Ability.
The battle ends after 2 subsequent turns where no player play neither a card neither an ability
Battle Turns
During the “Engaging in Battle” step of combat, players alternate taking battle turns, starting with the defender. Only the player currently taking his battle turn can use abilities (such as those found on tech cards or culture event cards) or play units. A player’s battle turn consists of:
1. Opportunity to use an ability
2. Play a unit
3. Opportunity to use an ability
4. Battle turn ends After a player plays his last unit, he does not take any more battle turns. Can a player win a battle if he has no units in the battle, but he has a high enough military bonus to win? A: Yes Can a player use resource abilities from tech cards during his “turn” in combat if he has no units left in his hand? A: Yes

When an army figure moves into a square containing a village marker, an enemy army figure, or an enemy city, a battle takes place.

* Finite resource
  This relationship is shown on the unit cards by their trump symbols. For example, infantry units are particularly effective against mounted units (e.g., pikemen versus knights), so infantry units have the mounted unit symbol as their trump symbol. When a unit attacks or is attacked by a unit that it has pictured on its card as a trump symbol, it trumps that unit, dealing its damage before the other unit can do so. If this damage kills the trumped unit, the trumped unit deals no damage back to the unit trumping it, since it is already dead before it can deal its damage.
  
Combat Bonuses
* Except cities, Do not include squares blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure
* +2 for every Barracks the player has built
* +4 for every Academy the player has built
* +4 for every Great General the player has on the map
* +6 if defending a non-capital city
* +12 if defending a capital city
* +4 if defending a walled capital or non-capital city (stacks with either of the two other city bonuses).

## Post-combat
After both players have played all of their battle forces, the battle is over. First, all wounds are removed from the surviving units in the battle. Then, each player tallies up the strength of all of their surviving units, adding in the value of the combat bonus card (if they have it). The player with the highest total wins the battle, with ties going to the defender. Winner’s Figure Losses The winner then loses one army figure in the square for every two units of theirs that were killed in the battle. A player’s last army figure in the square can never be lost this way

If the loser had one or more figures in the square: The winner gains 1 loot. If the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities: The winner gains 2 loot. If the loser was defending their capital city: The winner immediately wins the game with a military victory.

Each time a civilization’s social policy maximum decreases, its player chooses a social policy card it currently has and returns it to its pile of unused social policies (any policy on the card can be re-adopted later).

1 Loot Effects
* Steal up to three points of trade from the loser’s trade dial.
* Steal up to three culture tokens from the loser.
* Steal any one resource token from the loser (facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they are before choosing).
* Force the loser to discard a coin token of the winner’s choice. This cannot affect investments.

2 Loot Effects
* 2 1-loot effects (the same or different)
* Learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner does not know, without having to pay the trade cost. The winner must have a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so.
* Steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. The winner only gets to look at the card backs when choosing.
* Steal one of the loser’s coin tokens and place it on the winner’s civilization sheet. This cannot affect investments.

. If it is a wonder, the wonder marker and card are
returned to the box and may not be rebuilt for the remainder of
the game.

When a great person marker is killed (normally by a culture event or the destruction of a city), the player must check to see whether they now have too many great person cards of that type. A player may only have one great person card for each great person marker of that type they possess (including markers on the map and those held in reserve), regardless of whether the cards are faceup or facedown. Thus, a player with two artist great person markers may have no more than two great artist cards total. If a player has too many of the same type of great person card, they must randomly discard cards of that type (one at a time) until they no longer have too many.
