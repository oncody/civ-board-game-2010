### Start of game
* Pick a starting social policy
* Agree on optional rules
* Agree on house rules
*  give each player one artillery, one infantry, and one mounted unit.
* Place one of each market resource token per player near the market board, returning any extras to the box
* Place capital
* Gain civilization bonus
* Place a single army figure in your city's outskirts
* Place a single scout figure in your city's outskirts
* Learn your civ's starting tech
* Set starting government
* Set trade dial equal to trade in your city's outskirts (you'll gain trade again on the first turn)
* Set economy coin dial to 0 (It is possible for some players to receive a coin from a map
  square or great person during setup. If this is the case, the player
  sets their economy dial to the number equal to the number of
  coins they have, instead.)
* Build the wonder deck
  * Shuffle and deal 4 of each type of wonder with the basic wonders on top of the deck, the middle wonders in the middle, and the advanced wonders on the bottom
   
### Potential House Rules
* Not necessarily have we all agreed on this
* If two friendly army units start on different squares but move into the same square, then they can move together as a group long as both units possess more movement points
* Don’t play with relic squares
* Maybe not play with as many water tiles?
* Should we play with all hut/village tiles:
  * City-states
  * Wealth (gain a coin)
  * Friendly barbarian (gain a military unit card)
  * Friendly workers: produce 4 extra
  * Native art: gain 3-6 extra culture
  * Teacher: learn a tech 1 for free

### Optional Rules:
* Investment deck
  * All players must agree at the start of the game whether to play with this
* Great person deck
  * All players must agree at the start of the game whether to play with this

### Cheat Sheet
* Starting travel speed for army and scout figures is 2
* Starting stacking limit for army and scout figures is 2
* Starting culture hand size is 2
  * If a player exceeds their culture hand size, then they must immediately discard down to their hand size before any culture event cards may be played
* Default hand size is 3 unit cards
  * +2 hand size for each friendly army figure in the square beyond the first
  * +1 hand size if governed by Fundamentalism
  * +3 hand size if defending a city or capital.
* Starting city limit is 2 (but can be increased to 3 with irrigation)

If the loser had one or more figures in the square:
The winner gains 1 loot.
If the loser was defending one of their non-capital
cities: The winner gains 2 loot.
If the loser was defending their capital city: The
winner immediately wins the game with a military
victory.

1 Loot Effects
* Steal up to three points of trade from the loser’s
trade dial.
* Steal up to three culture tokens from the loser.
* Steal any one resource token from the loser
(facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but
the winner does not get to see what they are before
choosing).
* Force the loser to discard a coin token of the
winner’s choice. This cannot affect investments.
  
2 Loot Effects
* 2 1-loot effects (the same or different)
* Learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner
does not know, without having to pay the trade cost.
The winner must have a legal spot in their tech
pyramid to do so.
* Steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. The
winner only gets to look at the card backs when
choosing.
* Steal one of the loser’s coin tokens and place it on
the winner’s civilization sheet. This cannot affect
investments.
  
### Potentially anytime abilities:
Great person cards
If a player has at least one great person token
matching the card’s type that is not blockaded, the card
ability can be used. If a player does not have at least one great
person token matching the card’s type that is not blockaded,
then the card ability cannot be used for as long as the token is
blockaded.

* Culture cards
* Resource abilities
* Limited to once per use
* Wonder cards
* Wonders are not immune to blockades either. While an enemy figure remains in the same square as a wonder’s marker, the special ability on the wonder’s card cannot be used and the culture produced by its marker cannot be collected.

### Start of Turn Phase
* Turn phase 1
* One at a time
* Advance first player token
* Skip the first turn of the game
* Start of turn abilities
* Do not include squares blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure
* Convert a scout into a city and adopt a new social policy

Change government
Change to a government unlocked last turn
Change to anarchy for a turn (then next turn you can change to any government)
Change to any government you have unlocked (requires you to have been in anarchy for a turn)
Invest a coin (if playing with investments)
Coins printed on the map, printed on tech cards, or printed on buildings cannot be invested
Can only invest coin tokens
Lower your number of coins by 1
Gain an investment marker
This coin no longer counts towards your 15 coin victory condition
Investments cannot be discarded from play by other players.

### Trade Phase
* Turn phase 2
* Parallel
* Collect trade from all cities and record it in your trade dial
Include squares controlled by your scout that are not in your outskirts
Do not include squares blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure
Trade resources with other players
Points of trade
Unspent culture tokens
Resource tokens
Culture Event cards

### City Management Phase
* Turn phase 3
* One at a time

At any point during their City Management Phase, a player may
choose to spend some or all of their culture tokens to advance
their culture level marker up the culture track on the market
Board.

You cannot build a Building or a Wonder, or place a Great Person Marker, on a square where stands an enemy figure.

For each city:
Total up your production
Do not include squares blockaded by an enemy army or scout figure
You can rush production as many times as you want
Gain 1 production for 3 trade points spent
Build an army figure
Costs 4 production
Represent a civilization’s military forces
The only figures that can fight battles and explore huts and villages
Can blockade enemy squares
Buildings
Wonders
Great people
Great people cards
Can a player build an army figure with a city action and
place it in a square of that city’s outskirts that contains
enemy figures? Does this initiate a battle?
A: Yes. The battle takes place immediately
Build a scout figure
Costs 6 production
Represent a civilization’s non-military forces
May be used to build new cities
gather extra trade, production, or other resources for a city
Can blockade enemy squares
Buildings
Wonders
Great people
Great people cards
Cannot enter squares containing huts or villages
Are killed immediately any time they are attacked by an army, unless they have a friendly army escorting them.
This counts as a battle and triggers loot
Build a military unit card
Costs 5-11 production
Build a building (requires a tech to unlock it)
Each city can only have a single building with a star in its outskirts
Like units, buildings are limited to the number of components
available. Once all buildings of a certain type have been
produced, no more can be produced until one of the existing
buildings of that type is destroyed.
Build a wonder
You can have only 1 Wonder in each city.
Each time a wonder is purchased from the market, the
next wonder in the deck must be drawn and placed
faceup in the market to replace it, along with its
accompanying wonder marker. This rule was omitted
from the first printing of the rulebook by accident.
Even an obsolete Wonder must be replaced if you want to build a new Wonder in a city that already has one.
Devote to the Arts
Gain 1 culture
Gain 1 additional culture for each culture token in your outskirts
Gain 1 additional culture for each culture token your scout has if not in your outskirts)
Harvest a single resource in your city’s outskirts
Note that a player cannot harvest a given
resource if the market is out of that type of resource, and a city
may only harvest one resource per action.
Start a building program
Place a building program marker on the city
A city cannot have more than one building program marker on it at a time
The marker stays on the city until a figure, unit, building, or wonder is produced
The next time a city with a building program marker
is used to produce a figure, unit, building, or wonder,
discard the building program marker on the city and
double the amount of ! the city has in its outskirts for
the duration of the action. A city must use a building
program marker when it produces. The city does not
double any ! gained from other sources, such as
culture event cards or governments. Any excess ! after
the produce action is complete is wasted.
Disband an army
If a player disbands an army, they may choose to fortify
the city that the army figure was disbanded in. To do so,
the player takes a fortification/caravan marker and places
it on the city center, fortification side up. A fortification
marker indicates that temporary defenses have been built
to protect the city. When a player defends a fortified city,
they receive an extra +2 combat bonus.
If a fortified city successfully defends itself against an
attacker in combat, the fortification marker is discarded
(and if the city isn’t successfully defended, the city
is destroyed, of course). A city may only have one
fortification marker on it at a time, and a fortified city
cannot also have a caravan marker placed on it.
Disband a scout
If a player disbands a scout, they may choose to send a
caravan to the city that the scout figure was disbanded
in. To do so, the player takes a fortification/caravan
marker and places it on the city center, caravan side up.
A caravan marker indicates that the city is benefitting
from a burst of productivity. When a player takes a
build action in a city with a caravan marker, they may
discard the caravan marker to have the city produce 2
extra ! that turn.
8
A city may only have one caravan marker on it at a
time, and a city with a caravan cannot also have a
fortification marker placed on it.

### Movement Phase
* Turn phase 4
* One at a time
Move each of their figures (armies and scouts) up to a number of squares equal to the player’s travel speed.
Movement may cause battles to occur and facedown map tiles to be revealed
Move all of your figures before it passes to the next player
Figures cannot move diagonally
When discovering, flat part of triangle touches the figure that exposed it
An army figure that enters a square containing a hut
or village marker must immediately end its movement and is
considered to be exploring the hut or village.
Scouts cannot enter a square containing enemy figures. If
an army enters a square containing any enemy figures, its
movement immediately ends. If the square contains only enemy
scouts, the scouts are immediately killed and the attacking player
collects loot as though they had won a battle (see page 25). If
the square contains at least one enemy army, a battle occurs (see
page 23). If the square contains a mix of both enemy armies and
scouts, a battle occurs, but if the losing side in the battle has any
scouts in the square, they are killed along with the armies; loot is
then collected as normal.
Instead of the figure moving for
that square of movement, the map tile is turned faceup.
Once a figure has begun its move, it must complete its move before any other figure may move.
A player may move several of their figures as a group if they
all begin the Movement Phase in the same square. Doing so
can offer extra strength in battle (see page 23) or allow armies
to protect scouts (see page 20). Figures that begin in the same
square are not required to move together.
A player may move their figures through their own city centers,
but they may not end any figure’s movement in their city center.
Scouts may enter enemy city outskirts, but they cannot enter
enemy city centers. Armies may enter enemy city outskirts.
They may also enter an enemy city center, but doing so
immediately results in an attack on the city (see page 23).
Military bonuses and wonders abilities can be blockaded, even by a scout only, but it doesn’t send such abilities or bonus to the scouts’ owner. It does send the culture icons on the wonders.
In order to engage to a battle with a stack of 2 or more armies, they must be already in the same square at the beginning of your turn. This means that you have to group them in this turn if you want to attack with them all in the next turn.
Figures can move on friendly squares containing friendly buildings, wonders, great people, etc  but cannot end their movement on city centers.

### Technology Research Phase
* Turn phase 5
* parallel
Each player may learn one new tech by spending trade
They then add their newly learned tech to their tech pyramid
When a player learns a tech unlocking an upgraded
building, they immediately flip over any of the corresponding
basic buildings that they’ve already produced in their cities.
Researching a tech spends all of the player’s remaining trade,
no matter how much trade they had before researching. The
only exception to this rule is for players who possess coins.
Coins allow a player to retain 1 trade after researching for
each coin the player possesses. Having coins never increases a
player’s current trade; it only allows a player to retain trade they
already have.
A player does not need to know the tech that unlocks the
basic form of a building in order to learn the tech that unlocks
the upgraded form of that building.
The Railroad technology card should have a coin icon.
The Metal Casting technology card should not have a coin icon.
When you research a tech that grants you a coin, you gain it immediately for the sake of paying trades for that research.
When you invest a coin that was over a tech, you can freely refill the tech

When you research a technology that grants you a coin, this coin will count for the purpose of the trade you keep after researching that technology. For example, a player with 1 coin on his economic dial that researches Bureaucracy, will immediately increase his economic dial by 1, and so will retain 2 trades.
City Walls are an excellent defensive measure for a player to
build when it appears that one of their cities is in danger of being
attacked. A wall provides +4 to a player’s strength total when
defending that city and forces the attacker to play a unit first in
the battle (see pages 23–24)

### Cities and metropolises
Friendly figures may pass through but they cannot end their movement in a city center

If there are any friendly figures in the square where a city
is being built besides the scout being sacrificed, the player
immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can
legally end their movement in.

Making a new city:
Can only build 2 cities. 3 with irrigation.
Cannot be water
Must be eight revealed squares around it
Cannot be adjacent to a hut or village token
Cannot be adjacent to an enemy figure
Its outskirts must not overlap with any other city’s outskirts

Upgrading a city into a metropolis:
A metropolis has two extra squares in its city
outskirts.
• When devoted to the arts, a metropolis produces a
base of 2 culture instead of 1.
• A metropolis receives an extra +2 combat bonus
when a player is defending it.
• A metropolis may extend partially into water and
doesn’t count as water for movement, so its owner
can use it as a makeshift bridge.

The metropolis marker must occupy the square that
the capital marker occupied plus one of its four nondiagonally adjacent squares (this square is called its
expansion square).
• The expansion square must not contain any enemy
figures.
• If the expansion square contains any friendly
figures, the player immediately moves them to
an adjacent square that they can legally end their
movement in.
• If the expansion square contains a wonder, great
person, or building, then the square’s previous
contents are overbuilt, as described in the core
rulebook.
• An expansion square may be a water square. If so,
the square is no longer considered to be water for
purposes of movement.
• The metropolis’s new outskirts cannot overlap
another city’s outskirts, nor can the outskirts extend
off the map or into unexplored territory

If the expansion square contains any friendly
figures, the player immediately moves them to
an adjacent square that they can legally end their
movement in.

### Military Unit Cards
If a unit deck is empty, units of that type are not
available to be produced until some are killed and returned to the
deck. If players go through the entire deck of a type of unit and
arrive at units that have been returned faceup to the bottom of
the deck, they must turn the deck over and shuffle it.

This relationship is shown on the unit cards by their trump
symbols. For example, infantry units are particularly effective
against mounted units (e.g., pikemen versus knights), so infantry
units have the mounted unit symbol as their trump symbol.
When a unit attacks or is attacked by a unit that it has pictured
on its card as a trump symbol, it trumps that unit, dealing its
damage before the other unit can do so. If this damage kills the
trumped unit, the trumped unit deals no damage back to the unit
trumping it, since it is already dead before it can deal its damage.

### Scout figure
Scouts are of vital importance to a player’s civilization. One of
their critical roles is to send home trade, production, culture,
coins, and resources from distant locations. Each turn, beginning
the turn after it was placed on the map, a scout gathers the
contents of the square it occupies. The player declares which of
their cities the scout is “sending” the square to during the Start
of Turn Phase, and all of the icons in that square (including
trade, production, culture, coins, and resources) are then
considered to be in that city’s outskirts for the rest of the turn.
Consequently, the city benefits from any trade, production, or
other icons in the square for the turn.;l.;.,
A scout in the outskirt of a city can transfer that square to another city, but the original city can’t use the icons at the same time.

Two scouts in the same square can’t gather twice the resources, hammers, etc.

Can a scout gather icons and/or resources from a square
in another city’s outskirts? What if the square contains a
building or a wonder?
A: A scout can gather resources from a square in another city’s
outskirts, even if that square contains a building or wonder. If
the scout sends those icons and resources to a different city,
the original city cannot also use those icons and resources.

### Army figure

### Blockade
Blockade: When a square in a city’s outskirts contains an enemy
figure. The presence of the enemy figure prevents the use of that
square by the city it is part of the outskirts of.

: If a player that is blockading a barracks moves his army
figure off of that barracks to attack a city center, does the
defender gain the benefit of the barracks?
A: Yes. When the army figure leaves the barracks square and
enters the city center, the barracks is no longer blockaded and
may be used by the defender during the battle./,lmjlk;

### Combat
slaughtering scouts generates loot
All wounds go away at the end of the battle.
You don’t get a coin here when you defeat an enemy Scout without battle (although you do get loot for doing this).
The defender plays first, except if defending a city with wall.
Your turn in a battle is Ability > Card > Ability.
The battle ends after 2 subsequent turns where no player play neither a card neither an ability
Battle Turns
During the “Engaging in Battle” step of combat, players
alternate taking battle turns, starting with the defender. Only the
player currently taking his battle turn can use abilities (such as
those found on tech cards or culture event cards) or play units. A
player’s battle turn consists of:
1. Opportunity to use an ability
2. Play a unit
3. Opportunity to use an ability
4. Battle turn ends
   After a player plays his last unit, he does not take any more
   battle turns.
   Can a player win a battle if he has no units in the battle,
   but he has a high enough military bonus to win?
   A: Yes
   Can a player use resource abilities from tech cards during
   his “turn” in combat if he has no units left in his hand?
   A: Yes
   
### Great Person
When a great person marker is killed (normally by a
culture event or the destruction of a city), the player
must check to see whether they now have too many
great person cards of that type. A player may only have
one great person card for each great person marker of
that type they possess (including markers on the map
and those held in reserve), regardless of whether the
cards are faceup or facedown. Thus, a player with two
artist great person markers may have no more than two
great artist cards total. If a player has too many of the
same type of great person card, they must randomly
discard cards of that type (one at a time) until they no
longer have too many.


### Wonder
Certain techs (Monarchy and Gunpowder) allow a player to
obsolete a wonder. When a wonder is obsoleted, turn its wonder
card facedown, but leave its wonder marker on the map. The
wonder’s special ability is negated and cannot be used for the
rest of the game. However, the wonder marker still produces
culture when the city it is in is devoted to the arts.


### Coins
Coins gained from squares on the map – whether from a natural
gold deposit in the mountains or from a building placed in a
square – are only kept as long as the player retains control of the
square (i.e., the square is contained in the outskirts of one of the
player’s cities or one of the player’s scouts remains in the square
to gather from it). If an enemy figure blockades the square
containing the coin, it is lost while the enemy figure remains
there (see page 27). Similarly, if a building granting a coin to a
player is destroyed, the coin is lost.

### Social Policy:
After a civilization
has adopted a social policy, it cannot adopt another
social policy from that same card (to use the reverse
side of the card, the social policy must be switched).
Losing Social Policies
Each time a civilization’s social policy maximum
decreases, its player chooses a social policy card it
currently has and returns it to its pile of unused social
policies (any policy on the card can be re-adopted later).
Switching Social Policies
Normally, after a social policy is adopted, it cannot
be changed. This makes the decisions of which social
policies to adopt very important. There are certain
effects, such as the new Bureaucracy tech (level II), that
allow a civilization to switch a currently adopted social
policy to a different social policy. When switching
social policies, a player may either flip a currently
Social Policy Cards
Each social policy card has a title and one or
more abilities. Each “Start of Turn” ability on a
social policy card can only be used once per turn.
If a card has two abilities, both can be used once.
Start of Turn
Gain 1 @ for each of
your cities and 1 @ for
each of your city-states.
ExPansionism
Start of Turn
Spend 6 @ to learn
a level I tech.
Start of Turn
Spend 11 @ to learn
a level II tech.

adopted social policy to its reverse side, or switch out a
currently adopted social policy card for a different card
that he is not currently using
