## Game Overview
Civilization is a turn-based strategy game where you play a civilization and balance your economic and military power. There is a map and you will need to expand your geographic domain strategically to emerge victorious.

## Victory Conditions
The first player to achieve one of these four victory conditions wins the game:

1. Military Victory - Conquer an enemy capital in battle
1. Culture Victory - Advance to the end of the culture track
1. Economic Victory - Reach 15 coins
1. Technology Victory - Research a tier 5 technology

## Game Setup
1. Agree on optional rules
1. Agree on house rules
1. Place one of each market resource token per player near the market board
1. Build the wonder deck with 4 of each type of wonder with the basic ones on top

## Player Setup
1. Pick a civilization
1. Set your government to your civilization's starting government
1. Find your civilization's starting technology and add it to the bottom of your tech tree
1. Pick a starting social policy
1. Set economy coin dial to 0
1. Place capital
1. Gain civilization bonus
1. Set trade dial equal to trade in your city's outskirts (you'll gain trade again on the first turn)
1. Place a single army figure in a legal square in your city's outskirts
1. Place a single scout figure in a legal square in your city's outskirts
1. Take one artillery card
1. Take one infantry card
1. Take one mounted card

## Optional Rules
1. Investment deck
1. Noble deck
  
## House Rules
Not necessarily have we all agreed on these

1. If two friendly army units start on different squares but move into the same square, then they can move together as a group long as both units possess more movement points
1. Don’t play with relic squares
1. Maybe not play with as many water map tiles
1. Change military tradition social policy to read: Once per turn, when you build a unit, you may pay 2/3/4 more production to build an army figure
1. Scouts can steal combat bonuses from buildings and send them home
1. Can choose when to consume a building program
1. Scouts can explore huts (but not villages)
1. You can build cities and metropolises on edges of the map (not next to unexplored map tiles)
1. Defenders can choose at the start of battle whether to use the city fortification token or not
1. Should we play with all hut/village tokens:

| Hut/Village Token | Cody's thoughts |
| --- | --- |
| City-states | seems strong but not OP. you can contest it. Maybe remove the +4 combat bonus |
| Coin | Maybe instead of it being a coin token, it just be a coin on the map so people can contest it |
| Military unit | OP |
| +4 production | OP |
| +3-6 extra culture | OP |
| Learn tech 1 for free | OP |

## Initial Phase
Advance first player token (skip this the first turn of the game). This phase is done in turns. The first player fully completes this phase before it passes to the next person. You may any of the following actions as many times as you want.

### Construct City
Requirements:
1. Starting city limit is 2
1. Cannot be built on water
1. Its outskirts must contain eight revealed squares, must not overlap with any other city’s outskirts, and cannot contain an enemy figure, hut token, or village token (it is valid once the hut or village token is removed from the map)

To build a city, sacrifice your scout. Move any other friendly figures in this square to a legal adjacent square. Add a city token to the map where your scout was. If your city has a gold coin printed on the map in one of its outskirts, then increase your coin tracker by 1. Adopt a new social policy. Each “Start of Turn” ability on a social policy card can only be used once per turn. If a card has two abilities, both can be used once. 

When you lose a city, then you lose a social policy card (but can later re-learn that same one if you want). Additionally, when you lose a city, if one of your outskirts had a gold coin, then lower your gold tracker by 1.

### Play Noble
Play a reserved noble on your civilization sheet into one of your city's outskirts

### Change Government
Change your government in one of the following ways:
1. Change to a government you unlocked last turn
1. Change to anarchy for a turn (on your next turn you can change to any government)
1. Change to any government you have unlocked (requires you to have been in anarchy for a turn)

### Investments
Requirements:
1. Can only invest coin tokens
1. Can not invest coins printed on the map, printed on technologies, or printed on buildings

To invest a coin, lower your economy coin dial by 1. This coin no longer counts towards your 15 coin victory condition 1. Place an investment token on an investment card. Investments cannot be removed by other players

## Trade Phase
Trade is used to research technologies and can be converted to production in the production phase. Trade is saved from turn to turn. Everyone does the following actions at the same time in any order

### Harvest Trade
Add together the number of trade icons in all of your cities' outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though). Increment your trade dial equal to the total number of trade icons
   
### Trade Resources
You can trade and make non-binding promises with other players. You can trade any of the following resources with other players:
1. Trade Points
1. Resource tokens
1. Culture tokens
1. Culture cards

## Production Phase
This phase is done in turns. The first player fully completes this phase before it passes to the next person

### Culture Track
At any time during this phase, you may pay to advance on the culture track as many times as you want

#### Culture Track Advancement Cost
| Tier | Culture Cost | Trade Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | 3 Culture | 0 Trade |
| Tier 2 | 5 Culture | 3 Trade |
| Tier 3 | 7 Culture | 6 Trade |

#### Culture Track Advancement Benefits
| Square you advance to | Benefit |
| --- | ---  |
| Column Icon | Draw a culture card |
| Star Icon | Gain a noble |

One at a time, for each of your cities do the following: 

### Harvest Production
Add together the number of production icons in your city's outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though). You are able to spend this production only during this turn. Any unspent production at the end of this phase will be lost.

#### Rush Production
If you want to perform a city action, but you don't have enough production then you can rush production. You can convert 3 trade points to a single point of production, as many times as you want. 

### Perform only one of the following actions:
#### Store Production
Place a building program token on the city (max 1 building program token per city). The next time this city spends production, double the production generated and remove the token

#### Deploy Army
Costs 4 production. Limited to 6 army figures. Place an army figure in a legal square in your city's outskirts where you built this unit. If this square contains an enemy unit, a battle immediately takes place
    
#### Deploy Scout
Costs 6 production. Limited to 2 scout figures. Place a scout figure in a legal square in your city's outskirts where you built this unit

#### Recruit Military
Determine which military card you want to recruit. Pay the cost corresponding to what rank you are for that unit. Add that card to your military hand. There are only a limited number of military cards.

| Rank | Production Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Rank 1 | 5 production |
| Rank 2 | 7 production |
| Rank 3 | 9 production |
| Rank 4 | 11 production |

#### Recruit Aircraft
This requires you to have the flight technology unlocked. An aircraft costs 12 production. Add an aircraft card to your military hand.

#### Construct Building
A building is a type of architecture that you can purchase from the market. It can increase your trade, production, culture, coins, and military bonuses. Every building requires a specific technology to be researched to unlock it. Each city can only have a single building with a star in its outskirts. Architecture cannot be built on a square containing an enemy figure.

To construct a building, place this building in your city's outskirts (you may replace an existing architecture). If you build a water building on a water square, that square is still considered to be water for the sake of movement. Buildings are limited
    
#### Construct Wonder
A wonder is a type of architecture that you can purchase from the market. They are all unique and have special abilities. Each city can only have 1 wonder. Architecture cannot be built on a square containing an enemy figure. Place this wonder in your city's outskirts (you may replace an existing architecture) and gain the wonder's card. Replace the wonder from the market.

Wonders are not buildings and abilities that affect buildings do not affect wonders unless explicitly stated. If a wonder is blockaded by an enemy, you cannot use the wonder's card. Obsoleting a wonder destroys the wonder card but leaves the wonder in play. When a wonder leaves play, also remove the wonder's card.

#### Harvest Culture
When you harvest culture, gain culture as follows. Gain 1 culture (2 if the city is a metropolis). Gain 1 additional culture for each culture token in your outskirts that are not blockaded by an enemy. All squares friendly scouts occupy are considered to be part of one of your city's outskirts (you can never get double income from a square though)

#### Harvest Resource
Harvest a single market resource in your city’s outskirts (if the market has a corresponding token available). Market resources include:
1. Wheat
1. Silk
1. Incense
1. Iron

## Movement Phase
This phase is done in turns. The first player fully completes this phase before it passes to the next person. One at a time, for each of your figures you can perform a move action. If multiple figures start the movement phase in the same square, then they can choose to perform their move action together if the player wants (they don't have to move together). This can be beneficial to increase your combat hand size. Move up to your figure travel speed. You must fully finish this move action before beginning a move action with any other figure.

| Ability | Army | Scout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Represents | Military | Economy |
| Can explore facedown map tiles | Yes | Yes |
| Can blockade architecture | Yes | Yes |
| Can send resources home | No | Yes |
| Can construct cities | No | Yes |
| Can bolster a city's production | No | Yes |
| Can explore huts and villages | Yes | No |
| Can attack enemy figures and cities | Yes | No |
| Can fortify a city's defenses | Yes | No |

Movement Rules:
1. Base travel speed is 2
1. Base stacking limit is 2
1. Cannot move diagonally
1. Can end their movement on friendly buildings, wonders, and nobles
1. Can move through friendly city centers, but they can only end their movement on it if they wish to sacrifice that figure and gain a benefit
1. Cannot move across water until the tech is researched
1. Cannot end their movement on water until the tech is researched

### Armies
Armies represent a civilization's military power. They can explore facedown map tiles, blockade architecture, explore huts and villages, fortify a city's defenses and attack enemy figures and cities. 

If an army enters a square containing enemy figures or cities, it ends its movement and a battle takes place. If the defender only has scouts, then the battle is immediately victorious for the attacker. 

If an army ends its movement in a friendly city center, then remove it from the board to add a fortification token on that city center (max of 1 per city). The next time this city is attacked consume the token to gain a +2 combat bonus.

### Scouts
Scouts represent an economical unit of a civilization. They can explore facedown map tiles, blockade architecture, send resources home, construct cities, and bolster a city's production. Scouts always send the resources of the square they are occupying to a friendly city, effectively making that square included as part of that city's outskirts. When scouts are blockading architecture, they can send home any resources printed on that building too.

Resources a scout can send home:
1. Resources (Wheat, Silk, Incense, Iron)
1. Coins
1. Trade
1. Production
1. Culture

If a scout ends its movement in a friendly city center, then remove it from the board to add a caravan token on that city center (max of 1 per city). The token can be consumed to gain an additional 2 production.

### Blockade
Any figure can blockade an enemy square by moving onto a square containing an enemy architecture. While blockaded, that architecture cannot be used in any capacity. While a wonder is blockaded, the wonder's card cannot be used. While a noble is blockaded, the noble's card cannot be used.

### Exploration
Any figure can explore a facedown map tile. Exploring a facedown map tile requires the figure to have a point of movement speed available and it consumes that point of movement speed. When the map tile is flipped faceup, orient it with its triangle on the same side as the figure that explored it.

### Huts
If an army enters a square containing a hut, it ends its movement. Then remove and add the hut resource token from the map to your civilization sheet. Keep this hidden from others until you use it. 

### Villages
If an army figure enters a square containing a village, it ends its movement and then that player will fight the barbarians. The next player will represent the barbarians in battle. The barbarians (being played by the next player) receive a rank 1 archer unit card, a rank 1 spearman unit card, and a rank 1 horseman unit card. Then they engage in battle until it is finished. If the main player wins, they remove the village token from the map and add it to their civilization sheet. Keep this hidden from other players until you use it. After the battle, ignore loot effects.

## Technology Phase
This phase is done in secret by all players at the same time. Each player can research a single technology if they wish. To research a technology, a player needs to have enough trade available to pay for it. 

### Technology Cost
| Technology Tier | Trade Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | 6 trade |
| Tier 2 | 11 trade |
| Tier 3 | 16 trade |
| Tier 4 | 21 trade |
| Tier 5 | 26 trade |

Additionally, to research a technology you need to have a slot available for it in your tech pyramid.

### Technology Pyramid
Technologies are stored in a pyramid with tier 1 technologies being placed in the base of the pyramid. You can always purchase a tier 1 technology and add it to your base (tier 1 technologies can only be placed in the first row). Tier 2 technologies need to be placed above two tier 1 technologies and must be placed in the second row. Tier 3 technologies need to be placed above two tier 2 technologies and must be placed in the third row. Tier 4 technologies need to be placed above two tier 3 technologies and must be placed in the fourth row. Tier 5 technologies need to be placed above two tier 4 technologies and must be placed in the fifth row.

You can research technology that unlocks upgraded buildings even if you don't know the basic form of that building. You can skip military upgrades as well. You can upgrade a military unit from tier 1 to tier 4 if you want. Once you research a technology, lower your trade to the number of coins you have (investments do not count as coins). If you had more coins than trade, then your trade remains the same (you can never gain trade from this). Add the technology to your tech pyramid.  When a player learns a tech unlocking an upgraded building, they immediately upgrade any of the corresponding basic buildings that they’ve already constructed in their cities. When you research a technology that grants you a coin, this coin will count for the purpose of the trade you keep after researching that technology.

Resource abilities on technologies can only be used once per turn.

Errata:
The Metal Casting technology card should not have a coin icon.
The Railroad technology card should have a coin icon printed on it.
  
### Metropolis
Your capital can be upgraded to a larger metropolis by researching the agriculture tech. 

Metropolis benefits:
1. A metropolis has two extra squares in its city outskirts
1. When harvesting culture, a metropolis produces a base of 2 culture instead of 1
1. A metropolis receives an extra +2 combat bonus when a player is defending it

To upgrade your capital the following conditions must be met:
1. The metropolis must contain the square the capital occupies
1. The metropolis's outskirts must contain ten revealed squares and must not overlap with another city’s outskirts
1. The expansion square must not contain any enemy figures
1. The expansion square may be a water square
1. The expansion square may contain architecture

To build a metropolis, remove your capital and replace it with a metropolis. If the expansion square contains any friendly figures, the player immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can legally end their movement in. If the expansion square contained architecture, then replace that architecture. If the expansion square was a water square, then this square is no longer treated as a water square (relevant for the sake of movement).

## Architecture
Architecture includes buildings, wonders, and nobles. Architecture cannot be built on a square containing an enemy figure. When building architecture, you can replace existing architecture. If a building is replaced, it is returned to the market. If a wonder is replaced, both the wonder and its card are removed from the game forever. If a noble is replaced, reserve the noble on your civilization to be played later. While a noble is reserved, you cannot use its card.

## Culture
### Culture Cards
When you advance on the culture track, you will often gain culture cards. These cards are kept secret from other players until you play them and they say at the top of the card which phase you can play these cards in. Your starting culture hand size is 2 and if you ever exceed your hand size, you must immediately discard down to it before you can play any culture card
  
### Nobles
Sometimes when you advance on the culture track you will gain a noble. If you are playing with the optional noble deck, then draw a noble's card and a matching noble. If you are not playing with the noble deck, then just draw a random noble. When you gain a Noble, either immediately add it to a square that is not occupied by an enemy figure in your outskirts (you may replace an existing architecture) or reserve this token on your civilization sheet to play later.

Noble cards are kept secret from other players until you play them. They say what phase they can be played. A noble card cannot be played or used unless you have a matching noble in play (not reserved). If a noble is blockaded by an enemy, you cannot use its card. When a noble is replaced, add it to your reserve. When a noble is destroyed, also lose its card.

## Combat
When a battle commences, both players shuffle and draw unit cards equal to their combat hand size.

### Combat Hand Size
| Ability | Combat Cards |
| --- | --- |
| Base | 3 |
| Fundamentalism government | +1 |
| Each additional friendly army | +2 |
| Defending a city center | +3 |

The attacker typically has the advantage as they are catching the defenders off guard. If the defender is defending a walled village, the attacker takes their turn first. Otherwise, the defender takes their turn first. Combat consists of players taking combat turns one at a time until both players have played all of their units and are done using abilities.

### Combat Turn
1. Use an ability
1. Play a unit in a front
1. Use an ability

When you play a unit, you play it in a front. You cannot play a unit in a front that you already have a unit in. You can choose any front to play it in, including a new front (you can make as many fronts as you want). When a unit is played in a front occupied by an enemy, the two units duel. A unit has a strength and health value. When units duel, they will deal damage to each other equal to their strength. If one unit counters another, then that unit deals its damage first. For each point of damage a unit takes, put that many wound tokens on it. If a unit ever has wound tokens on it equal to or greater than its health, then it dies. If a unit was countered, it can die before dealing damage to the other unit.

### Unit Counter Table
| Unit | Unit that it counters |
| --- | --- |
| Infantry | Cavalry |
| Cavalry | Artillery |
| Artillery | Infantry |

Once battle is done, each player calculates his combat score. To calculate your combat score, add the health value of all your surviving units and subtract it by the total number of wound tokens on your units. Then calculate your combat bonus below. Add your combat score to your combat bonus. Whichever player has the higher value wins that combat, with defender winning ties.

### Combat Bonuses
Architecture that is blockaded does not generate combat bonuses

| Ability | Combat Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| Barracks | 2 |
| Academy | 4 |
| Great General | 4 |
| Non-capital city defense | 6 |
| Walled city defense | 4 |
| Capital city defense  | 12 |
| Metropolis capital city defense  | 2 |

After a battle is done, remove all wound tokens from units and return any units that survived to their owner hands. The loser loses all of their figures that took place in that battle. If the loser was defending a city, the city is destroyed along with all architecture in its outskirts. If the loser was defending their capital, the winner wins the game via a combat victory. For every two units the winner lost in battle, the winner loses one of their army figures (but never loses their last army unit).

### Combat Loot
| Loser | Reward |
| --- | --- |
| Only figures (not defending a city) | Minor Loot |
| Defending non-capital city | Major Loot |

### Minor Loot
Choose one of the following:
1. Steal up to three points of trade
1. Steal up to three culture tokens
1. Steal a resource token (you can choose a hut or village token but do so blindly)
1. Discard a coin token of your choice. Cannot discard invested coins

### Major Loot
Choose one of the following:
1. 2 minor loots (they can be the same or different)
1. Copy a tech without paying the cost. Must have a legal spot in your tech pyramid
1. Steal a culture card blindly
1. Steal a coin token and place it on the winner’s civilization sheet. Cannot steal invested coins
